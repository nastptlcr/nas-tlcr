    "content" : "# Demo Summary\n\nThe demo contains all types of levels to demonstrate the training capabilities of the KYPO Cyber Range Platform.\n\n**Note**: It is recommended to use the Chrome browser. In case you run into difficulties with submitting the answer, try to Log out and Log in again. \n\n| Level | Level Name | Level Type |\n|:------:|------| ------ |\n| 1. | Info | Info |\n| 2. | Finding Open Ports | Training |\n| 3. | Connecting via Telnet | Training |\n| 4. | Privilege Escalation | Training |\n| 5. | Test Example | Assessment |\n| 6. | Assessment Example | Assessment |\n\n## Info\n\nThe level contains this information page.\n\n## Finding open ports\n\nThe level provides information on how to connect to a sandbox. In general, there are two possible options. The first option is to use the platform'a GUI to connect to the machine via Spice console. The second option is to connect through SSH with a generated config file and keys.\n\nThis level's small challenge is to scan open ports.\n\n## Connecting Via Telnet\n\nThis level's challenge is to connect to the server machine without a password and discover the secret answer.\n\n## Privilege Escalation\n\nThis demo's bigger challenge is to gain root privileges and read an answer available only to a root user. Enjoy! \n\n## Test Example\n\nThe level contains a simple example of a test. Tests can be used, for example, for additional testing of students for grading purposes.\n\n## Assessment Example\n\nThe level contains a simple example of a test. For example, the tests can be used to verify the learning outcomes or for collecting feedback.\n"

    "content" : "Your goal is to get access to a **server**. You know that there is a **telnet** service running on the server but it is not running on the default port. Your first task is to find the **port** on which the telnet service is running. The answer is the port number.\n\nBelow are two options how to connect to the client from which you can connect to the server.\n\n## GUI access\n1. In the topology overview, click the button in the top-right corner of the graph, then **`Expand All`**, **`client`** and **`Generate console URL`**. After a few moments, **`Open link`** next to the **`Generate console URL`** should appear.\n\n2. Login using username **`kypo`** and password **`kypo`**.\n\n## SSH from local machine\n1. Use the **`Get SSH Access`** button to download **`ssh-access.zip`**.\n\n2. Extract the **`ssh-access.zip`** file to your **`~/.ssh/`** directory.\n\n    `$ unzip ssh-access.zip -d ~/.ssh/`\n\n3. Change the SSH private key permissions if needed.\n\n    `$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-key`\n\n4. Connect to the client virtual machine specified in the SSH configuration.\n\n    `$ ssh -F ~/.ssh/pool-id-ID-sandbox-id-ID-user-config client`",
    "solution" : "1. Connect to the client using either of the options.\n\n2. Look for open ports using the command **`nmap server`**. You can see **ssh** running on port **22** and some other service running on port **2323**. This has to be the **telnet** service.\n\n3. Enter **`2323`** as the answer.",
